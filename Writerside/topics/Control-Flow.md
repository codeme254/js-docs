# Control Flow

Control Flow refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a program.

By default, JavaScript code runs line by line from top to bottom, but control flow structures allow us to alter this 
execution.

Control flow in JavaScript is achieved with:
- Conditionals
- Loops
