# JavaScript Classes

Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have a formal `class` keyword.

With ES6, JavaScript introduced the class syntax, making OOP more structured.

A class refers to the blueprint of an object.

## Creating a class
To create a class in JavaScript, you use the class keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class,
you define a constructor method to initialize object properties.
```JavaScript
class User {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
```
The `constructor` method initializes the object's properties.

## Creating instances of a class
To create an instance of a class, use the `new` keyword.

```JavaScript
class User {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const user1 = new User("John Doe", 25);
user1.greet(); // My name is John Doe
```
