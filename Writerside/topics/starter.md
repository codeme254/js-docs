# Introduction

JavaScript is the programming language for the web that enables us to add interactivity and dynamic functionalities to
our websites.

It is one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML (structure) and CSS (styling).

JavaScript is primarily used to create dynamic web pages by controlling behaviors such as form validation, 
animations, and real-time updates.

## Key Characteristics of JavaScript
### Client-side and Server-side
Originally designed for web browsers, JavaScript executes directly in the browser (client-side). However, with 
environments like Node.js, it can also run on servers (server-side).

### Interpreted language
JavaScript is not compiled like languages such as C++ or Java. Instead, the browser or runtime environment reads and 
executes the code directly, making development faster and more flexible.

### Dynamic types
Unlike statically typed languages where variable types must be declared, JavaScript determines data types at runtime. 
This makes it more flexible but also prone to certain errors.

### Multi-paradigm
JavaScript supports different programming styles, including:

- **Procedural programming** (step-by-step instructions)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (using objects and classes)
- **Functional Programming (FP)** (treating functions as first-class citizens)

### Event-driven
JavaScript allows developers to define actions that occur in response to events, such as a user clicking a button or 
submitting a form.

### Prototype-based*
JavaScript does not use traditional class-based inheritance (like Java or C++). Instead, it follows prototype-based 
inheritance, where objects inherit properties from other objects.

### Asynchronous and Non-Blocking*
JavaScript can handle multiple operations at once using asynchronous programming, primarily with callbacks, promises, 
and async/await. This makes it suitable for real-time applications like chat apps and live notifications.

## Where JavaScript is Used
- **Web Development**: Interactive elements, animations, forms, and APIs.
- **Mobile App Development**: Frameworks like React Native allow JavaScript to build cross-platform apps.
- **Backend Development**: With runtimes like Node.js and bun, JavaScript can power servers and databases.
- **Game Development**: JavaScript and WebGL enable web-based games.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Libraries like TensorFlow.js allow AI models to run in browsers.
