# Asynchronous JavaScript

Asynchronous JavaScript refers to the execution of JavaScript without blocking the main thread, allowing other
operations to continue while waiting for other tasks to complete.

This is essential for tasks such as network requests, file reading, and timers which can take an unknown amount of time.

JavaScript is inherently single-threaded and synchronous. This means it processes one task at a time sequentially.

When a long-running task such as fetching data from a server or reading a file occurs, it can block the entire
execution, making the application unresponsive, this is what asynchronous JavaScript solves.

With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other 
tasks in parallel.

In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is done using **Promises**.

**Example of what asynchronous JavaScript looks like:**

```JavaScript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Asynchronous JavaScript");
}, 2000);

console.log("Hello World");
console.log("Goodbye World");

// Output:
// Hello World
// Goodbye World
// Asynchronous JavaScript
```
